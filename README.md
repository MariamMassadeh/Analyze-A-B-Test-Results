Introduction
AB testing: is a type of experimentation that helps to compare two different versions of a web page to check which one has more clicks or visitors.

Project: I have to understand the A/B results of an e-commerce website.
The company developed a new web page to increase the number of users who "convert"; I mean the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
So in this notebook I want to help the company to understand if they should:

implement this new page.
keep the old page.
or run the experiment longer to make their decision.

What I have to use?
Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3 (pandas, numpy, matplotlib and statsmodels).
